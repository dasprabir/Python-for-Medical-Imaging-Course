Python for Medical Imaging â€“ Course Summary
Course Overview
This repository documents my completion of the "Python for Medical Imaging" course offered on Udemy by Dr. Joan S. Muthu.
The course introduces Python programming concepts tailored for medical image processing, including hands-on exercises in handling and analyzing formats like DICOM, PNG, JPEG, NIfTI, and TIFF.

What I Learned
Image Formats

Worked with 8-bit (PNG, JPEG, BMP) and 16-bit grayscale and color images

Learned to process specialized formats like DICOM and NIfTI

Reading & Writing Medical Images

Used pydicom, nibabel, imageio, and Pillow to read, visualize, and save medical images

Extracted and modified metadata from image headers

Python Libraries Used

pydicom, nibabel, imageio, matplotlib, PIL, numpy, opencv-python

Image Processing Techniques

Image transformations: resizing, cropping, rotation

Denoising and contrast enhancement

Feature extraction basics

Visualization

Displayed 2D and 3D slices of CT, MRI, and X-ray images using matplotlib and plotly
